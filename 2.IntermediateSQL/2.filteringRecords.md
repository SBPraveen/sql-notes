# WHERE
Allows us to add condition to our queries.  
```sql
SELECT name
FROM staff
WHERE age > 40; 
```

## <>
For checking condition we have <, >, =, >=, <=.  
<> indicates not equal.
```sql
SELECT name
FROM staff

LIMIT 10;
```
The order of execution of the above code is 
- FROM
- WHERE
- SELECT
- LIMIT
