## COUNT

Count the number of **records present** in the table.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM employees;
```

Count the number of records in which the age is specified.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(age) AS count_age
FROM employees;
```

Count multiple fields at the same time.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(age) AS count_age, COUNT(gender) AS count_gender
FROM employees;
```
op =>  
|count_age|count_gender|
|---|---|
|120|213|


**Count** the number of **distinct** age 
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT age) AS count_distinct_age
FROM employees;
```

SQL code is **not processed in its written order**
Eg: 
```sql
SELECT age
FROM employees
LIMIT 10;
```
Here FROM(table) gets executed first then SELECT(column name) then finally LIMIT gets executed.  
  
SQL querires formatting is not required(but writing unformatted code is not a good practice).  
```sql
select age, gender, college from employees limit 3
```
This is a valid SQL code but should be avoided.

**Note** ðŸ§   
If a table is created in which the field names have spaces(created by mistake - no of seats instead of no_of_seats). The field name should be closed within double quotes to access the column.
```sql
SELECT "no of seats"
FROM cars;
```
