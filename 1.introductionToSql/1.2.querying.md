## SELECT
The select keyword indicates which field should be selected.  

## FROM 
The from keyword indicates the table in which the fields are located   

```sql
SELECT gender, age 
FROM employees;
```

**Note** : Best practice  
 - add ;  to indicate the end of a query.
 - Break queries into multiple lines for readability.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

**Note**  
"*" => indicates all columns.

## AS
Used to rename column ie. **Aliasing**. This doesnt affect the field name in the table.

```sql
SELECT name AS first_name
FROM employees
```

## DISTINCT
To avoid
