# Query
A query is a request for data from the database.

## SELECT
The select keyword indicates which field should be selected.  

## FROM 
The from keyword indicates the table in which the fields are located   

```sql
SELECT gender, age 
FROM employees;
```

**Note** : Best practice  
 - add ;  to indicate the end of a query.
 - Break queries into multiple lines for readability.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

**Note**  
"*" => indicates all columns.

## AS
Used to rename column ie. **Aliasing**. This doesnt affect the field name in the table.

```sql
SELECT name AS first_name
FROM employees;
```

## DISTINCT
When the DISTINCT keyword is used the output will be a **list of unique values**  
**Eg:1**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT age
FROM employees;
```
  
**Eg:2**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT age, gender
FROM employees;
```
  
In this case the combination of age and gender will be unique.  
  
age gender  
2 &emsp; M   
3 &emsp; F  
2 &emsp; F  

## VIEWS
A view is a virtual table(Not stored in the database) that stores the result of the SELECT statement. Once a view is created we can query it just like a normal table. When a view is created there is no result set for the SELECT statement.   

```sql
CREATE VIEW employees_gender_age AS
SELECT gender, age 
FROM employees;
```

## LIMIT/TOP  
Limit(PostgreSQL)/Top(SQL Server) is used to limit the number of records returned.  
SQL has a few different versions. Except a few syntax the rest will be same between the different SQL versions.  
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server  
- etc...
