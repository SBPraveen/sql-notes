# Database
  A database stores data.  
  Databases are made up of tables.  

# Relational Database
  Relational database defines the relationships between the tables present in the database.  

# SQL
  Structured Query Language.  
  SQL is used for creating, querying and updating databases.  
  SQL is used when an organization has lots of data with complex relationships.

# Tables
  Tables consists of rows(**Records**) and columns(**Fields**).  
  **Table names** should be **lowercases** and should **not** contain any Markdown Code Block(use underscores instead). Also table names should be plural. Eg : products table  
  **Field names** should be **lowercases** and should **not** include any **spaces**. Also field names should be singular. Eg: name, age.  
  A table should not contain two identical field names and the field names should be different from the table name.
  When a table is created the **datatype of each field** should be mentioned.  

# Data types in SQL

# Schemas
  Schemas are referred as blueprints of the databases. They show the databases's design ie. what tables are included in the database and the relationship between them and also the data type of each field present in the table.
